# Description
This project is created to learn how to use React to build single page web applications. Various examples from other people have been used to Implement features in this project. The following is list of goals/tasks I am hoping to achieve with this project.

# Done
* Setup basic application scaffolding
  * webpack and webpack hot dev server
  * use react for some very basic pages
* Use react-router for navigation across pages
* Include Bootstrap for styling

# In-progress
* Replace Bootstrap components with Material-UI

# TODO
* Setup less or sass
* Use redux for actions and events
* Use redux dev tools and time travel
* Implement login functionality (possibly OAuth2 with JWT?)
* more stuff...
